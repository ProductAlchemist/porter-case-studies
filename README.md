# Porter Product Case Studies

Hey! I'm Kshitij, a Product Manager who believes the best way to showcase product work is through detailed case studies with real metrics and honest learnings.

These aren't sanitized success stories - they're real products with real constraints, trade-offs, and lessons learned.

**What you'll find:**
- Actual metrics and business impact
- Technical architecture and platform design decisions
- What worked and what didn't
- Honest reflections on constraints and trade-offs
